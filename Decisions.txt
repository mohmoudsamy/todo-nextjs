### Welcome to todo list application coded by next.js and supabase

## Firstly, I prepared how the database is configured.
## Two tables one for the lists and the other for the users info.

## As authentication process is provided by the database, I used the process to create a user and then let him log to save the list he creates based on its id (table => lists: column => user_id).

## Each authenticated user can edit its own lists and only see the lists of others.
